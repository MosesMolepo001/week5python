# OOP Activities: Classes, Inheritance & Polymorphism

## Activity 1: Smartphone Classes with Inheritance

- `Smartphone` class represents a generic smartphone.
- Attributes: brand, model, storage size, battery percentage.
- Methods: make calls, charge battery, show info.
- `GamingSmartphone` inherits from `Smartphone`.
  - Adds a cooling system attribute.
  - Adds a method to play games (reduces battery).
  - Overrides `info()` to show cooling system status.

## Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge üé≠

- Abstract `Vehicle` class defines a `move()` method.
- `Car`, `Plane`, and `Boat` classes inherit from `Vehicle`.
- Each subclass implements `move()` differently to represent their unique movement styles.

## How to Run

1. Save the code in a `.py` file.
2. Run it with Python 
3. Observe output for class behaviors and polymorphic method calls.
