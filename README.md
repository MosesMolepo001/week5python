# File Read & Write Challenge üñãÔ∏è

This project contains a Python script that reads a text file, modifies its content, and writes the result to a new file. It also handles common file-related errors gracefully.

---

## Files

- `file_processor.py` ‚Äî Python script that:
  - Asks for a filename from the user
  - Reads the file content
  - Converts the text to uppercase
  - Writes the modified text to `modified_output.txt`
  - Handles errors like file not found or permission denied

- `input.txt` ‚Äî Sample input file with text to test the script

## How to Use

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your computer.
2. Place `file_processor.py` and `input.txt` in the same directory.
3. Open your terminal or command prompt in that directory.
4. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python file_processor.py
